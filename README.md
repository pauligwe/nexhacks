An advanced prediction market analytics platform that helps investors hedge their stock portfolios using Polymarket prediction markets. The system uses **Wood Wide AI** for numeric reasoning and risk analysis to identify portfolio vulnerabilities and recommend actionable hedges.

## Overview

Polymarket Terminal demonstrates a complete **numeric decision workflow** using Wood Wide AI:

1. **What happened?** → Portfolio risk analysis identifies concentration risks, sector exposures, and anomalies
2. **Why does it matter?** → Wood Wide AI classifies portfolio profiles and calculates numeric risk scores
3. **What should happen next?** → Actionable hedge recommendations via Polymarket prediction markets

## Hackathon Tracks

### Primary: Polymarket
- Fetches real-time prediction market data from Polymarket's Gamma API
- Matches portfolio risks to relevant prediction markets
- Provides direct links to hedge positions on Polymarket

### Secondary: Wood Wide AI
- **Portfolio Classification**: Uses Wood Wide's numeric reasoning to classify portfolios (conservative, moderate, aggressive, speculative)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual positions that deviate from typical investor patterns
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculates interpretable risk scores (1-100) based on concentration, sector exposure, and position sizing
- **Pattern Analysis**: Detects risky portfolio patterns using structured data analysis

## 🧠 Wood Wide AI Integration

### Numeric Decision Workflow

The app implements Wood Wide's core principles:

**Structured Data Input**:
- Portfolio holdings (ticker, shares, value, weight)
- Sector concentrations
- Position sizes
- Historical patterns from reference portfolios

**Numeric Reasoning**:
- Classification model trained on reference portfolio data
- Anomaly detection comparing user portfolios to typical patterns
- Risk score calculation using multiple numeric factors

**Actionable Outputs**:
- Portfolio profile classification with confidence scores
- Specific anomaly alerts for unusual positions
- Numeric risk scores with clear thresholds
- Hedge recommendations tied to specific risks

### Wood Wide API Workflow

```typescript
// 1. Upload portfolio data as structured CSV
const dataset = await woodWideClient.uploadDatasetCSV(portfolioData);

// 2. Train/use anomaly detection model
const model = await woodWideClient.trainAnomalyModel(dataset.id);

// 3. Run inference to detect anomalies
const anomalies = await woodWideClient.detectAnomalies(model.id, dataset.id);

// 4. Generate interpretable insights
const insights = generateInsights(anomalies, classification);
```

## Wood Wide AI Examples

### Portfolio Classification
```
Input: Portfolio with 80% tech stocks, 3 holdings
Output: "Speculative" profile (92% confidence)
Insight: "High concentration risk - similar to portfolios that saw 50%+ drawdowns"
```

### Anomaly Detection
```
Input: Portfolio with one 45% position
Output: Anomaly detected on NVDA (score: 0.87)
Insight: "Position size exceeds typical institutional limits of 10-15%"
```

### Risk Scoring
```
Input: Diversified 20-stock portfolio
Output: Risk Score: 42/100
Insight: "Moderate risk - tech exposure and concentration within normal ranges"
```
